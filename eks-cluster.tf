    # in an extra set of list brackets. That form was supported for compatibilty in
    # v0.11, but is no longer supported in Terraform v0.12.

    # If the expression in the following list itself returns a list, remove the
    # brackets to avoid interpretation as a list of lists. If the expression
    # returns a single list item then leave it as-is and remove this TODO comment.
